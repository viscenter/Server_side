Server work

These are the files in the server play ground. This file contains most of the software tool I used the most over the summer of 2012. Below is the list of tool I used and investigated.
-Teem (scientific imaging library)  
-UNU (command line tool using teem)
-RegistrationPlay (output file for the InsightToolKit-3.20.1)
-ctsPlay(The CTS3 universal DEMO CTS service)
-CHS(extension to the CITE allowing region selection (never worked for me))

These files should not be in long term storage.

Thank you
